        Frogers is a game that is like tag but 
        the tager is called the Froger
        when the froger tags a person that person is a froger too
        also at the beginning some one will do Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
        and who ever it lands on they are the froger
        and some one will say "Runners Run" that means all runners need to Run
        when they say "Frogers Tag" all frogers go and tag.
